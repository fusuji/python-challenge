 python homework for week 3
hello to whoeever reads this!
my homework instructions instructed me to provide a "thorough" readme though I am not sure what to put here...
this repository is to provide the grader my own answer to the homework prompted. 
there are two challenges given, each with their own different scenario

thank you for your time!
